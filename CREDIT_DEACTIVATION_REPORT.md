# Credit Deactivation Audit & Fix Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive audit and fix of all credit-related logic to ensure subscriber balances are correctly updated when purchases and gift credits are deactivated. The implementation addresses critical race conditions and ensures data consistency through proper transaction management.

## Key Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Purchase Deactivation Logic Flaws**
- **Issue**: Previous logic simply subtracted earned credit without checking if it was already transferred from pending_credits
- **Impact**: Could result in double-subtraction of credits, leading to incorrect subscriber balances
- **Fix**: Implemented intelligent credit adjustment that checks pending credit transfer status

### 2. **Missing Active Column in pending_credits**
- **Issue**: No soft-delete capability for pending credits
- **Impact**: Deactivated purchases could still have their pending credits processed by cron job
- **Fix**: Added `active` column with proper indexing and migration support

### 3. **No Gift Credit Deactivation Logic**
- **Issue**: No mechanism to properly deactivate gift credits and adjust subscriber balances
- **Impact**: Deactivated gift credits remained in subscriber balances
- **Fix**: Implemented proper gift credit deactivation with immediate balance adjustment

### 4. **Race Condition Vulnerabilities**
- **Issue**: No transaction safety between pending credit transfers and deactivations
- **Impact**: Potential for inconsistent subscriber credit balances
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive transaction-based operations

## Database Schema Changes

### New Migration: `add_active_column_pending_credits.sql`
```sql
-- Add active column to pending_credits table for soft delete functionality
ALTER TABLE `pending_credits` 
ADD COLUMN `active` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 COMMENT 'Active status: 1=active, 0=deactivated';

-- Add index for better performance when filtering by active status  
ALTER TABLE `pending_credits` ADD INDEX `idx_pending_credits_active` (`active`);

-- Update the existing query index to include active status for optimal performance
ALTER TABLE `pending_credits` DROP INDEX `idx_pending_lookup`;
ALTER TABLE `pending_credits` ADD INDEX `idx_pending_lookup_active` (`subscriber_id`, `transferred`, `active`, `created_at`);
```

**Impact**: Enables soft-delete functionality for pending credits with optimized query performance.

  - Updated monitoring to only check active pending credits
  - Enhanced logging for better audit trail

#### `delete_transaction.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced flawed credit subtraction logic with new `deactivate_purchase_with_credit_adjustment()`
  - Added proper transaction management
  - Improved error handling and logging

#### `gift_credit_utils.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `deactivate_gift_credit()` function for proper gift credit deactivation
  - Integrated with new credit deactivation utilities
  - Maintained permission checking and validation

## Example Scenarios & Before/After Balances

### Scenario 1: Purchase Deactivation Before Pending Transfer

**Setup**:
- Subscriber has 10 credit points
- Makes purchase of 500,000 Toman (earns 5 pending credit points)
- Purchase is deactivated before 48-hour waiting period

**Before Fix**:
- Subscriber balance: 10 → 5 (incorrectly subtracted 5 points)
- Pending credit: Still exists and would be processed by cron

**After Fix**:
- Subscriber balance: 10 → 10 (unchanged, as credit wasn't transferred yet)
- Pending credit: Deactivated (active = 0), won't be processed by cron

### Scenario 2: Purchase Deactivation After Pending Transfer

**Setup**:
- Subscriber has 10 credit points
- Makes purchase of 300,000 Toman (earns 3 credit points)
- After 48 hours, cron transfers pending credit (balance becomes 13)
- Purchase is then deactivated

**Before Fix**:
- Subscriber balance: 13 → 8 (incorrectly subtracted another 3 points = double subtraction)

**After Fix**:
- Subscriber balance: 13 → 10 (correctly subtracts the 3 points that were already transferred)

### Scenario 3: Gift Credit Deactivation

**Setup**:
- Subscriber has 20 credit points
- Receives gift credit of 250,000 Toman (50 credit points), balance becomes 70
- Gift credit is later deactivated

**Before Fix**:
- Subscriber balance: 70 → 70 (no adjustment, incorrect)

**After Fix**:
- Subscriber balance: 70 → 20 (correctly subtracts 50 gift credit points)

## Cron Job Changes

### Updated Processing Logic
- **Before**: Processed all pending credits where `transferred = 0`
- **After**: Processes only pending credits where `transferred = 0 AND active = 1`

### Enhanced Monitoring
- Added warnings for inactive pending credits older than 7 days
- Improved logging for audit trail
- Better error handling and recovery

## Transaction Safety & Race Condition Prevention

### Key Improvements
1. **Atomic Operations**: All credit adjustments wrapped in database transactions
2. **Consistent State**: Ensures subscriber balances remain accurate even during concurrent operations
3. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all credit actions for debugging and compliance
4. **Error Recovery**: Proper rollback mechanisms on failure

## Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Purchase deactivation before pending transfer
- ✅ Purchase deactivation after pending transfer
- ✅ Gift credit deactivation with balance adjustment
- ✅ Cron job processes only active pending credits
- ✅ Race condition prevention
- ✅ Error handling and rollback scenarios

### Validation Results
All tests pass, confirming:
- Subscriber balances remain consistent
- No double-subtraction occurs
- Deactivated records are properly excluded from processing

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing data remains unaffected
- Migration automatically adds required columns with safe defaults

### Performance Considerations
- Added strategic indexes to maintain query performance
- Optimized pending credit lookup with composite index
- Minimal overhead for new active column checks

### Security & Permissions
- Maintained existing permission checks for gift credit management
- Added admin tracking for audit trail
- Proper validation and sanitization maintained
