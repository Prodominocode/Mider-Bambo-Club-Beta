 * Manual Migration Script for Double Credit Transfer Fixes
 * Run this to apply the database schema changes
 */

echo "=== Double Credit Transfer Fixes - Manual Migration ===\n\n";

echo "Database Migration SQL Commands:\n";
echo "================================\n\n";

echo "1. Add unique constraint to prevent duplicate pending credits:\n";
echo "```sql\n";
echo "ALTER TABLE pending_credits \n";
echo "ADD UNIQUE KEY unique_purchase_pending (purchase_id, subscriber_id) \n";
echo "COMMENT 'Prevent duplicate pending credits for same purchase';\n";
echo "```\n\n";

echo "2. Add optimized index for transfer queries:\n";
echo "```sql\n";
echo "CREATE INDEX idx_pending_transfer_ready ON pending_credits (transferred, created_at, active);\n";
echo "```\n\n";

echo "Code Changes Summary:\n";
echo "====================\n\n";

echo "1. **pending_credits_utils.php - add_pending_credit() function:**\n";
echo "   - Added duplicate entry handling in catch block\n";
echo "   - Returns true if duplicate entry (considers it successful)\n";
echo "   - Added detailed error logging\n\n";

echo "2. **pending_credits_utils.php - process_pending_credits() function:**\n";
echo "   - Added FOR UPDATE row locking in SELECT query\n";
echo "   - Changed order: Mark as transferred FIRST, then add credit\n";
echo "   - Added check for rowCount() to ensure atomicity\n";
echo "   - Added detailed logging for each processed credit\n";
echo "   - Skips already transferred records to prevent double processing\n\n";

echo "3. **process_pending_credits_cron.php:**\n";
echo "   - Added file-based process lock to prevent concurrent execution\n";
echo "   - Lock file: logs/pending_credits_cron.lock\n";
echo "   - Proper lock cleanup on both success and error\n";
echo "   - Non-blocking lock (LOCK_NB) to exit gracefully if already running\n\n";

echo "Key Security Improvements:\n";
echo "=========================\n\n";

echo "✅ **Race Condition Fix:**\n";
echo "   - Credit update and transferred flag are now atomic\n";
echo "   - Row locking prevents concurrent processing of same record\n";
echo "   - Mark as transferred BEFORE adding credit prevents double processing\n\n";

echo "✅ **Concurrency Control:**\n";
echo "   - File-based locking prevents multiple cron jobs running simultaneously\n";
echo "   - Lock is automatically released on completion or error\n\n";

echo "✅ **Data Integrity:**\n";
echo "   - Unique constraint prevents duplicate pending credits for same purchase\n";
echo "   - Graceful handling of duplicate entries in application code\n";
echo "   - Enhanced logging for audit trail\n\n";

echo "✅ **Idempotency:**\n";
echo "   - Function can be called multiple times safely\n";
echo "   - Already transferred credits are skipped\n";
echo "   - No double credit issues even if cron runs multiple times\n\n";

echo "How the Fix Solves the Original Issue:\n";
echo "====================================\n\n";

echo "**Original Problem:** User 09122133687 received 49 points instead of 24.5\n";
echo "**Root Cause:** Non-atomic transfer allowed same pending credit to be processed twice\n\n";

echo "**Solution Applied:**\n";
echo "1. Row locking ensures only one process can handle a pending credit\n";
echo "2. Atomic operation (mark transferred first) prevents reprocessing\n";
echo "3. Unique constraint prevents duplicate pending entries\n";
echo "4. Process lock prevents concurrent cron execution\n\n";

echo "**Result:** Each pending credit is transferred exactly once, eliminating double credits.\n\n";

echo "To apply these fixes:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "1. Run the SQL migration commands above on your database\n";
echo "2. The PHP code changes are already applied to the files\n";
echo "3. Test with the test_double_credit_fix.php script\n";
echo "4. Monitor logs/pending_credits_cron.log for cron execution details\n\n";

echo "Files Modified:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "- pending_credits_utils.php (core logic fixes)\n";
echo "- process_pending_credits_cron.php (concurrency control)\n";
echo "- migrations/add_unique_constraint_pending_credits.sql (new)\n";
echo "- test_double_credit_fix.php (validation script)\n\n";

echo "Monitoring:\n";
echo "==========\n";
echo "Check logs/pending_credits_cron.log for:\n";
echo "- Process lock status\n";
echo "- Number of credits processed\n";
echo "- Any skipped (already processed) credits\n";
echo "- Error conditions\n\n";
